# Concepts

SQL Notebooks are a single markdown text document with additional support for SQL and no-code components that allow data teams to quickly build beautiful reports.
Blocks

Notebooks are made up of a series of blocks:

 - [SQL blocks](Sql%20Blocks) are used to write SQL queries against databases or other data sources.
 - [Markdown blocks](Markdown%20Blocks) allow you to use markdown formatted text.
 - [Chart blocks](Chart%20Blocks) Allow taking an SQL query and visualizing it as various charts and visualizations.
 - [Input blocks](Input%20Blocks) are interactive widgets that capture user inputs, you can then use them as variables within SQL queries.
