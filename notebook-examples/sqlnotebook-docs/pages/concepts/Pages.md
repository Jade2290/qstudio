# Pages

# QStudio 

Each markdown file within the root folder/pages becomes a page. 
By default qStudio launches the webpage at: http://localhost:8088/ . 
Pages can be nested within folders to any reasonable depth.

For example:

 - ``pages/index.md`` would be accessible as ``http://localhost:8088/markdown/``. 
 - ``pages/company/pnl.md`` would be accessible as ``http://localhost:8088/markdown/pages/company/pnl``.
 - ``pages/company/index.md`` would be accessible as ``http://localhost:8088/markdown/company``.
